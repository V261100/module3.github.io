  In computer science, Artificial intelligence (AI) sometimes called machine intelligence, it is intelligence possessed by machine. It is the process by which learning power is given to the machine so that it can take smart enough decisions itself. For the majority of people, Artificial Intelligence is limited to robots but its way vaster than it. It is a set of algorithms and it’s up to us that what data we want it to learn and how we train it. Today, Artificial Intelligence is being used in Chabot’s, Healthcare Industry, Defence, Cyber security, etc., also used in virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Bixby. Artificial Intelligence is more focused on increasing work efficiency, obtaining high precision and accuracy in work, reducing the cost of training and operation and getting the best results in the work field. Like every coin has the two sides, the same is in the case of Artificial Intelligence besides its advantages there are few disadvantages also. First, AI is unsustainable, it requires more power to function, and that is putting more pressure on the power sources of the earth but it can be improved. Second, it will result in the reduction of human jobs, as a machine can perform tasks in a much better manner than humans. Though the great entrepreneur Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have agreed that Artificial Intelligence could be a threat to humanity in the future but if it will be used in a regulated manner it can result in a better future making human life easier.

The term “Artificial Intelligence” was introduced as intelligence possessed by machines by John McCarthy in 1956 when he held the first academic conference on the subject. But the journey to understand if machines can truly think began much before that. In 1914 the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo demonstrates the first chess-playing machine, capable to play without any human intervention. After that in the year, 1955 Allen Newell and Herbert A.Simon created the “first artificial intelligence program” which was named “Logic Theorist”. This program has proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems and finds new and more elegant proofs for some theorems. None before this has ever imagined that someday machines will be capable to take smart enough decisions itself. In the year 1958, John McCarthy developed the programming language Lisp and after that people understood that “Artificial Intelligence” is something necessary for the future and started working on it, and very soon Lisp became the most popular programming language used in artificial intelligence research. But this is just a beginning and people started searching the more ways in which Artificial Intelligence could be beneficial and in 1961 the first industrial robot, Unimate, started working on an assembly line in a General Motors plant in New Jersey. One after one many development took place in the field of Artificial Intelligence such speech recognition machine, Wabot-2 (musician humanoid robot), driverless car, chat-bot, ASIMO robot and finally in the year 2016 Hong-Kong based company Hanson Robotics activated Sophia, a social humanoid robot, which is said to be the most intelligent humanoid robot till now. Many marvellous inventions took place and many companies like Google, IBM, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. are still working on it to further improve the remaining flaws in it.

In Artificial Intelligence, the decisions are taken from previously gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms. So we can achieve higher accuracy and precision in work and result in increased work efficiency. 
An average human can work for 5-6 hours a day excluding the breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for refreshing themselves. But using AI we can make machines that can work 24x7 without any rest.
This is one of the biggest advantages of AI. We can overcome the risky tasks such as defusing a bomb, exploring the deepest parts of oceans using AI robot. It can also be used effectively in any kind of natural or man-made disaster.
AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. While taking a decision humans will analyse many factors both emotionally and practically which can lead to biased judgments in some situations.
Daily applications such as Apple’s Siri, Window’s Cortana, Google’s OK Google are frequently used in our daily routine whether it is for searching a location, taking a selfie, making a phone call and many more.
AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirements. Therefore its creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines.
AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority of the work. Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can cause a problem to future generations.
AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and other works with robots, human interference is becoming less which will cause the problem in employment. Every organization is looking to replace human employees with AI robots as they can give better results when compared to humans.
AI can perform only those tasks which they are designed or programmed, anything out of that they tend to crash or give irrelevant outputs which could be a major backdrop.
Every coin has two sides, the same is in the case of Artificial Intelligence besides its advantages there are a few disadvantages also. But we as humans need to take care of those positive sides of the invention to create a better world. As long as we will be using AI in a controlled manner it will not cause any harm to humanity. But for future protective measures, we need to ensure that no one should be able to use the AI in the wrong manner.
